    "app_slug": "YOUR_APP_SLUG",
    "trigger_token": "YOUR_TRIGGER_TOKEN",

    "author": "Developer",
    "build_message": "Deploy build version 1.3.2 build number 11 to Beta test",
    "branch": "release/1.3.2",
    "environments": {
        "BUILD_CONFIGURATION" => "Production",        # Environment variable to override during Bitrise.io build

    }
)
```
